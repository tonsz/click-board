# click-board

Somehow inspired by 1 million checkboxes that eventually imitated the core functionality of r/place. This is a board where you can place a color on a specific box.

## suggestions

### more colors to choose from

- Right now, the `changeColor` function manipulates the classes that toggles the colors. To actually implement this suggestion, my idea is it will depend on manipulating the `background-color` with the script instead of css.

### toggling between box sixes

- User can have a choice in making the boxes smaller or bigger: 10x10, 20x20 or 50x50 boxes.
